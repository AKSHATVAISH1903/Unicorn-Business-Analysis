In this project, I leveraged Power BI to conduct a thorough analysis of unicorn businesses, focusing on various metrics and visualizations to gain actionable insights. The project encompassed the following key elements:

- **Slicers for Flexible Selection:** Implemented slicers enabling dynamic selection of Year, Continent, Country, Company, Industry, and City, allowing for targeted analysis based on specific criteria.

- **ROI Analysis with Matrix Chart:** Utilized Matrix Chart to identify the company with the highest Return on Investment (ROI), enabling stakeholders to pinpoint successful ventures.

- **Geographical Insights with Map Chart:** Employed Map Chart to visualize the distribution of unicorn businesses across different countries, facilitating an understanding of geographical trends.

- **Year-wise Unicorn Production with Stacked Column Chart:** Identified peak years of unicorn production using a Stacked Column Chart, aiding in historical trend analysis.

- **Industry-wise Unicorn Distribution with Stacked Bar Chart:** Created a Stacked Bar Chart to illustrate the distribution of unicorns across various industries, providing insights into industry dominance.

- **Key Metrics Displayed with Cards:** Utilized Cards to display essential metrics including Count of Companies, Continents, Countries, Cities, Industries, Sum of Funding, Sum of Valuation, and Average Years to Become a Unicorn, offering a concise overview of the unicorn landscape.

- **Investor Analysis with Stacked Bar Chart:** Investigated top unicorn investors using a Stacked Bar Chart, enabling stakeholders to identify key players in funding unicorn ventures.

- **Visual Formatting for Enhanced Presentation:** Ensured consistent formatting across all visuals/charts, including color schemes, fonts, and layouts, enhancing the overall presentation and readability of the analysis.

By employing Power BI's robust capabilities, this project provided stakeholders with actionable insights into the unicorn business landscape, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.
